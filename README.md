# Ada Constraint_Error: Array Index Out of Bounds

This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing an array element outside its defined bounds.  This leads to a `Constraint_Error` exception being raised.

The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to access an element beyond the array's size. The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version that prevents this error.

This is a crucial example to understand Ada's strong typing and bounds checking, essential for robust and reliable software development.
